            <p>Anime Tracker has been created to search through anime more efficiently, the filter above allows you to control the results you get when it comes to the random button and to search by genres.</p>
            <p>You can also just search for an anime directly if you know it's full or part of it's title (whether it's in japanese or english) and if there's an anime you like or feel like you want to track just head to it's page and click on the add to list button in the left menu.</p>
            <p>This home page may not always look this way, I'm trying to find a good way to show some kind of tutorial, I would appreciate any ideas. Just bear in mind that this application is still in an early beta stage and that there will be more to come.</p>
            <p>If you've got any good ideas just send me an email to <a href="mailto:support@myanimetracker.com" target="_top">support@myanimetracker.com</a></p>
