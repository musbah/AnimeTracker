# AnimeTracker
An application that helps you look for anime with the ability to add anime to a list.

This anime has been on the windows store for a while now at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/anime-tracker/9nblggh2rfwg , I've just been bored recently and though I would make it cross platform so here it is.

I'm not sure if anyone's ever really going to use it, but I'm going to work on this version from and though I would put it on github for the hell of it.

The code is still pretty messy moving from UWP to electron so I'm just going to do my best to fix that.
