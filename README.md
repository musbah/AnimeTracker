# AnimeTracker
An application that helps you look for anime with the ability to add anime to a list.  
Most of the anime information has been provided by Anime News Network's API.

# Run
If you just need to run this without having to build it (assuming npm,electron and all the dependencies are installed):
npm start

# Build
You can use any electron build tool, I use ([Electron Builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)) and run the below:
yarn dest

# About
This anime tracker has been on the windows store for a while now ([Store Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/anime-tracker/9nblggh2rfwg)), I've just been bored recently and though I would make it cross platform so here it is.

I'm not sure if anyone's ever really going to use it, but I decided that I was going to focus on this crossplatform version from now on. Putting it on github just for the hell of it because there's no reason not to.

The code is still pretty messy moving from UWP to electron I'm in the process of fixing that now.
